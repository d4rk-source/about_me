## Past experience

I have been actively exploring the cybersecurity space for over a couple of years. A year has past since i shifted my focus to Web3 security. During this time, I’ve been learning about blockchain technology, smart contracts, their vulnerabilities. While I’ve been doing bug bounties for six months without any major successes yet, the process has significantly sharpened my understanding of Web3 ecosystems.

Before diving into Web3, I gained hands-on experience with IoT and web hacking, experimenting with various techniques and tools. This diverse background has given me a strong foundation in problem-solving and identifying vulnerabilities across different domains.

## My character

I'm a hardworking and curious individual who thrives on challenges. I’m not afraid to ask questions or make mistakes because I see them as opportunities to grow.

I handle stress well, stay level-headed in tough situations, and communicate effectively with others. Always eager to learn, I’m constantly looking to improve myself and take on new experiences.

## My future

I plan to deepen my understanding of the Web3 ecosystem and continue to learn new security vulnerabilities and best practices.

My short-term goal is to start freelancing as a Web3 pentester, while adding Vyper and Rust to my toolkit.

In the long term, I aspire to become one of the most knowledgeable and trustworthy Web3 security experts in the industry.
