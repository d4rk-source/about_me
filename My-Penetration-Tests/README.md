This folder showcases my experience and expertise in penetration testing, including:  
- **Audit Competitions**: Highlights of security assessments Iâ€™ve conducted during competitions.  
- **Freelance Work**: Real-world penetration tests performed for clients.  
- **Bug Bounties**: Vulnerabilities identified and responsibly disclosed during bounty programs.  

This work reflects my skills and approach, giving you a clear idea of what to expect from me in future projects.  


P.S. I am currently participating in a live contest so there will soon be an audit here.
