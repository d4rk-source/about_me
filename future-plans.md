I plan to deepen my understanding of vulnerabilities and continue learning new techniques to strengthen my skills. 

My short-term goal is to start freelancing as a Web3 pentester, while mastering Rust and adding Vyper to my toolkit. 

In the long term, I aspire to become one of the most knowledgeable and trustworthy Web3 security experts in the industry.
